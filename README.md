AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for users and thoughts
the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database.
